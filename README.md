### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Dominic, I am a software developer and data analyst, combining the best of both worlds to build robust software products.
I enjoy coding in JavaScript and Python.
I am fascinated by AI Technology and see myself building AI-driven software products soon.
I am a polymath with a vast array of interests from technology to finance, from music to flying drones and traveling the world.
In my spare time, I like to explore Forex charts and watch football, especially Liverpool. I hope to watch from Anfield one day.
